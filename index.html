        <h2>A bit of history</h2>
        <p>Africa is one of the richest lands in the world, containing gold, diamonds, sapphires, and various minerals. During the colonial period, European countries and industrialists exploited these resources without sharing the profits with Africa, leaving the populations in poverty.
        <br><br>
        After colonialism, dictatorships and corrupt governments took over, continuing exploitation without bringing positive changes. Cooperation also failed to improve the situation. As a result, the majority of African countries became poorer over time.
        <br><br>
        Civil wars, ethnic conflicts, and revolutions further destabilized these nations, leading to an inevitably bleak future. Climate change worsened the situation, prompting many people to seek a better life in Europe. Can they be blamed? Unfortunately, Europe often fails to offer a better future, and thousands of migrants perish in the Mediterranean trying to reach European shores. In response, European countries have closed their borders, but this is not a solution.
